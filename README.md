# Simple Dashboard

> This is a simple dashboard implementation based in a mockup, using react and styled components

## how to run
> To run this application just execute these commands in the command line tool

`yarn`

`yarn start`

## Clarificacion
> I tried to use react-bootstrap to manage all the layout and the element, but I had some difficulties with this library and I didn't want to use raw bootstrap library, mainly because of the use of JQuery to make the components work and I think that react should no be used at the same time with JQuery.

###### This was done in about 4 hours to test the mockup implementation habilities. Thanks.
